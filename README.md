# Historical-Tuition-Evaluation
Thank you for taking the time to look at my python historical evaluation of tuition and federal contributions in the United States of America higher education system.  Please start by looking at the final.ipynb notebook, a general description of my project is housed there, as well as a video of me presenting the project.  Data samples are housed in the data samples file, and the ‘data_parsing_and_cleaning.ipynb’ and ‘data_analysis.ipynb’ files in this directory contain code I used to clean the data and get it in a readable format, as well as the necessary math done for comparison. I hope you enjoy it!
